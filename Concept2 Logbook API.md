This is the documentation for the Concept2 Logbook API. To use it, you’ll need to get an API key from Concept2.

If you have any questions on the API, please contact [ranking@concept2.com](mailto:ranking@concept2.com).

Before using the live API, you must first develop against the development server and database on [https://log-dev.concept2.com](https://log-dev.concept2.com/). When ready, please contact Concept2 for approval for the live API.

**Note:** Results and users in the development database may occasionally be reset. You should not rely on data persisting there.

All requests **must** be made over HTTPS.

Where possible, this API uses appropriate HTTP verbs for each action.

e.g.

| Verb | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | Used for retrieving resources. | `GET api/users/me/results`  
fetches all the workouts for the authenticated user |
| `POST` | Used for creating resources. | `POST api/users/me/results`  
with the correct payload will create a new workout for the authenicated user |
| `PATCH` | Used for updating resources. A PATCH request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource. As PATCH is a relatively new HTTP verb, resource endpoints currently also accept `POST` requests. | `PATCH api/users/me/results/123`  
will update a specific workout |
| `DELETE` | Used for deleting resources. | `DELETE api/users/me/results/123`  
will delete a specific workout |

The current version of the API is v1. By default, this is the version of the API that will be used. In order to avoid potential issues, you are encouraged to explicitly request this version via the Accept header.

`Accept: application/vnd.c2logbook.v1+json`

The API is not currently rate limited. This may change in the future. Abuse of the API will result in either rate limits or removal of access.

For requests that return more than one item (e.g. GET /users/1/results), the result set may be paginated. An additional meta element will be returned as such:

```json
{
    "data": [...]
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "total": 11,
            "count": 3,
            "per_page": 3,
            "current_page": 1,
            "total_pages": 4,
            "links": {
                "next": "http://log.concept2.com/api/users/1/results?number=3&page=2"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* **total** is the number of results

* **count** is the number in the current set

* **per\_page** is the number per set

* **current\_page** is the current page/set

* **total\_pages** is the number of pages available

* **links** contains next/prev links to help in fetching more results

The default number of results returned per page is 50. If you pass number=\[number\] as a query string parameter you can change the number of results you get back. The maximum number of results you can return in any call is 250.

Page numbering is 1-based and omitting the ?page parameter will return the first page.

All requests are returned with an HTTP Status Code. This can be used to test for errors.

For example, if you try to fetch the details of a user you do not have the rights to access, you will get a 403 Forbidden error.

```bash
GET /api/users/5 HTTP/1.1
Host: log.concept2.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer HA3n1vrNjuQJWw0TdCDHnjSmrjIPULhTlejMIWqq
```

will return

```bash
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "message": "User does not have rights to this resource",
    "status_code": 403
}

```

In case of an error, the status code is additionally passed in the response to the request along with a more descriptive message.

HTTP Status Codes include:

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Generic OK |
| 201 | Resource created |
| 401 | Invalid access token |
| 403 | User forbidden from this endpoint |
| 404 | Endpoint not found |
| 405 | Method not allowed (e.g. trying to DELETE a user is currently not supported) |
| 409 | Duplicate result |
| 422 | Can't be processed. Generally means a well-formed request which fails validation. |
| 500 | Error on behalf of the API |
| 503 | API temporarily unavailable |

As well as sending across the request body, you can also set optional HTTP custom headers to help with debugging and analytics. These can be sent over with every call and are as follows:

| Header | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X-Client-Version | The version number of your client | 1.2.34 |
| X-PM-Version | The performance monitor number, e.g. 3, 4, 5 | 5 |
| X-Firmware-Version | The version number of the firmware running on the monitor | 707 |
| X-Device | The name of the device the client is running on | iPhone 6 |
| X-Device-OS | The operating system the device is running | iOS |
| X-Device-OS-Version | The version of the operating system the device is running | 8.3 |
| X-Erg-Model-Type | If on a RowErg, the model type the PM is configured for. Values are integers defined in OBJ\_ERGMODELTYPE\_T in the BLE specification. 0 = D/E/RowErg/Dynamic, 1 = C/B, 2 = A | 1 |
| X-Other | Additional logging or debugging information. For example, if your app can use the USB LogBook or PM memory or BLE, you can pass these for analytics. | USB |

```bash
GET /api/users/5 HTTP/1.1
Host: log.concept2.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer HA3n1vrNjuQJWw0TdCDHnjSmrjIPULhTlejMIWqq
X-Client-Version: 6.42
X-PM-Version: 5
X-Device: Mac
X-Device-OS: OSX
X-Device-OS-Version: 10.10
```

Authentication [¶](#authentication)
-----------------------------------

The Logboook API uses [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2) for authentication.

All developers need to register their application with Concept2 before getting started. This can be done from the [API Key portal](https://log.concept2.com/developers/keys), and as the manager of the client you will be required to log in with a Concept2 Logbook account to create and manage your client. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret. The Client Secret should not be shared. If using the Authorization Grant, you’ll also need to register your redirection endpoint.

The OAuth Grant types implemented are **Authorization Code, Refresh, Client Credentials and Password**. These grants are used as follows:

**Authorization Code:** The main grant type for most applications. Users are directed to the Logbook to authorize the application, before being returned to the application with an authorization code which can be exchanged for an access token. The user never has to provide their username/password to the application.

**Refresh:** Access tokens only last for a certain period of time. They also come with a refresh token which, when the access token has expired can be exchanged for a new access token.

**Client Credentials:** This grant type is only available for certain applications and is used for activities such as creating a user account. The method through which the client obtains the user credentials is beyond the scope of this specification. If using the password grant, the client MUST discard the credentials once an access token has been obtained.

**Password:** This grant type is only available for certain trusted applications. Rather than the user authorize the application on the Logbook, instead the application directly exchanges the user’s password and username credentials for an access token.

All applications have access to the Authorization Code and Refresh grant types.

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has.

For the web flow using the authorization grant, requested scopes will be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

In order to prevent users rejecting authorization, you are encouraged to ask only for the permissions you currently need. You can request additional scopes by revisiting the authorization flow at a later date.

Below are a list of current scopes. Note: requesting the write version of a permission will also include the read version. You can request therefore “results:write” without also needing to request “results:read”.

To get more than one scope, they should be concatenated with a comma, e.g. to have read access to a user’s profile and their results, pass _user:read,results:read_

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| user:read | Grants read access to a user's profile |
| user:write | Grants read/write access to a user's profile |
| results:read | Grants read access to a user's results |
| results:write | Grants read/write access to a user's results |

Scopes should be passed when fetching an authorization code, and getting an access token (either with an autorization code or when using a refresh token). You should pass your original scope(s) for all subsequent calls. It is possible to request fewer scopes but not to request additional scopes after the initial authorization code.

**_Important_**: If a scope is not passed, it currently defaults to having _user:read,results:write_ as the scopes. This is for backwards compatibility with existing clients and this behaviour may change in the future. **Do not rely on passing nothing as a scope**. You may either receive fewer permissions than expected, or receive an authorization error.

### Authorization Code [¶](#authentication-authorization-code)

####

Get Authorization Code

[GET](#authentication-authorization-code-get)`/oauth/authorize?client_id={client_id}&scope={scope}&response_type={response_type}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}`

When you want to to authenticate a user via the Authorization Code grant, you need to first send them to the Logbook’s login and authorization system.

If the user then allows your application access, they will then be redirected to the callback URL you registered with ?code={authorization\_code} appended. You can then exchange this code for an access token.

#### Example URI

GET <https://log.concept2.com/oauth/authorize?client\_id=ugdsra2alx7okz94smztckk6q6vc314xdem6l6hj&scope=user:read,results:write&response\_type=code&redirect\_uri=https:/example.com/logbook>

client\_id

`string` (required) **Example:**ugdsra2alx7okz94smztckk6q6vc314xdem6l6hj

scope

`string` (required) **Example:**user:read,results:write

response\_type

`string` (required) **Example:**code

redirect\_uri

`string` (required) **Example:**<https://example.com/logbook>

**Response  `200`**

### Access Token [¶](#authentication-access-token)

####

Fetch authorization token

[POST](#authentication-access-token-post)`/oauth/access_token`

The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the following parameters using the “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body.

This will return an access token which can used to verify API calls. In order to minimise the effect of tokens being intercepted, each access token is only valid for a certain period, specified by the expiry\_in time, which is the lifetime in seconds of the token.

When an access token has expired, rather than request a new token with username and password, you should use the refresh\_token to get a new one. The lifetime of the refresh token is currently one year. Set the grant\_type to refresh\_token and pass the correct refresh\_token value. When you use it, as well as a new access\_token, you will also get back a new refresh token, meaning you can use the API indefinitely without the user needing to reauthenticate. If the user does not use the client for over a year, they will need to log back in.

**Note:** If using the password grant, it is important to use the refresh token rather than storing user credentials and reauthenticating that way.

Once you have got a valid access token, you can then use it in the HTTP headers of your API calls, for example:

```bash
GET /api/users/me HTTP/1.1
Host: log.concept2.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer TA3n1vrNjuQJWw0TdCDHnjSmrjIPULhTlejMIWqq

### Results [¶](#logbook-users-results)

####

Get Results

[GET](#logbook-users-results-get)`/api/users/{user}/results`

Get all results for the current user. The response is paginated. See Pagination for more information on how to work with paginated result sets.

It’s possible to filter the results and return only results that match certain criteria. To do this, pass the filter criteria as query string variables.

The following filter criteria are available:

| Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | Fetches only results where the workout date is on or after this. Should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Note: You can also use full "YYYY-MM-DD H:M:S" if required. | 2015-05-01 |
| to | Fetches only results where the workout date is on or before this. Should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Note: You can also use full "YYYY-MM-DD H:M:S" if required. | 2015-05-01 |
| type | Fetches only results of this type. Must be one of

* rower
* skierg
* bike
* dynamic
* slides
* paddle
* water
* snow
* rollerski
* multierg

 | rower |
| updated\_after | Fetches only results created or updated on or after this date. Should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Note: You can also use full "YYYY-MM-DD H:M:S" if required. The timezone of the updated\_after date is GMT, so you should convert to this when making the call. | 2015-05-01 12:54:23 |

For example, to get all rower results in May 2015, call:

```bash
GET /api/users/me/results?from=2015-05-01&to=2015-05-31&type=rower
```

#### Example URI

GET <https://log.concept2.com/api/users/me/results>

Add a new workout. Following are the list of values that can be sent as part of the message body. **Note:** the Logbook filters for duplicate workouts, so will return a Duplicate Entry error if you post a workout which has the same date, time and distance as an existing workout. **Note:** We recommend you use our [Online Validator](https://log.concept2.com/developers/validator) tool to check workouts for errors, especially if uploading interval workouts.

| stroke\_data | No | array | Array of objects containing stroke data. See below for more info. |  |
| metadata | No | object | Object containing meta data. See below for more info. |  |

These are the possible values for the workout field.

The following fields are possible. Note: split and interval data are validated for type and expected values. Sending across a decimal value or a string where an integer is expected (e.g. stroke\_rate or calories\_total) will result in the workout failing.

Possible values are

| Name | Required | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| splits | No | array |
| intervals | No | array |
| targets | No | object |

Splits and intervals are an array of objects. Each object can contain the following fields:

| Name | Required | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| distance | Yes | integer | In meters. **Note:** for interval workouts this is work distance only. Rest distance is set separately (see below). | 5000 |
| time | Yes | integer | Time in tenths of a second. e.g. one minute would be 600. **Note:** for interval workouts this is work time only. Rest time is set separately where available (see below). | 1200 |
| stroke\_rate | No | integer | Average stroke rate | 34 |
| calories\_total | No | integer | Total calories | 26 |
| heart\_rate | No | object | An object with integer values for one or more of the following optional fields:

* average
* min
* max
* ending
* rest
* recovery

 |

"heart\_rate": {
    "average": 140,
    "ending": 160,
    "rest": 70
}

 |

The following fields are also for **interval workouts only**.

| Name | Required | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | Yes | string | Must be one of:

* time
* distance
* calorie

 | time |
| rest\_time | Yes | integer | This is the value in tenths of a second of the time spent in rest intervals. | 300 |
| rest\_distance | No | integer | This is the distance in meters spent in rest intervals. This should be included for Variable interval workouts only. | 50 |
| machine | No | string | Must be one of:

* skierg
* rower
* bike

. This should be included for MultiErg workouts only. | row |

Each workout can also have an optional set of targets which the athlete tried to hit during the workout. For split and fixed distance/time/calorie intervals, these targets should at workout level (i.e. the same level as split or interval data). For variable interval workouts, the target should be at the level of each individual interval. The targets object is optional, and all keys in it are optional. Note, only one of watts, calories or pace can be present (i.e. you can not set both a target 500m pace and a target watts).

| Name | Required | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stroke\_rate | No | integer | Can be between 0 and 255. The key is stroke\_rate even for BikeErgs. | 30 |
| heart\_rate\_zone | No | integer | Can be between 0 and 5. 0 would indicate a target heart rate zone is not set. | 4 |
| pace | No | integer | Time in tenths of a second | 1020 |
| watts | No | integer | Can be between 0 and 999 | 400 |
| calories | No | integer | Can be between 0 and 9999 | 1300 |

Strokes are an array of objects which can contain the following fields for each stroke:

| Name | Required | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t | No | integer | **Time**. In tenths of a second. e.g. 23 is 2.3 seconds. | 23 |
| d | No | integer | **Distance**. In decimeters, e.g. 155 is 15.5 meters | 155 |
| p | No | integer | **Pace**. Pace in tenths of a second, e.g. 971 is a pace of 1:37.1. This is pace per 500m for the rower and SkiErg, and pace per 1000m for the BikeErg. | 971 |
| spm | No | integer | **Strokes Per Minute**. Value as of current stroke rate. | 35 |
| hr | No | integer | **Heart Rate**. Value of current heart rate | 156 |

**Note:** Time and distance are incremental rather than the difference between the previous stroke. For interval workouts, time and distance start again at 0 for each interval.

When adding results, instead of using headers to send across metadata, you can also send them across as part of the result body. This is especially useful if using the bulk results endpoint and submitting multiple results at once which may have been rowed on different machines. All values are optional. **Note:** If sending across both metadata headers and as part of the result body, the ones sent as part of the result body will be used.

| Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| client\_version | The version number of your client | 1.2.34 |
| pm\_version | The performance monitor number, e.g. 3, 4, 5 | 5 |
| firmware\_version | The version number of the firmware running on the monitor | 707 |
| serial\_number | The serial number of the monitor | 430395351 |
| device | The name of the device the client is running on | iPhone 6 |
| device\_os | The operating system the device is running | iOS |
| device\_os\_version | The version of the operating system the device is running | 8.3 |
| erg\_model\_type | If on a RowErg, the model type the PM is configured for. Values are integers defined in OBJ\_ERGMODELTYPE\_T in the BLE specification. 0 = D/E/RowErg/Dynamic, 1 = C/B, 2 = A | 1 |
| hr\_type | Either BT, ANT or Apple | Apple |
| other | Additional logging or debugging information. For example, if your app can use the USB LogBook or PM memory or BLE, you can pass these for analytics. | USB |

Add Results

[POST](#logbook-users-multiple-results-post)`/api/users/{user}/results/bulk`

If you want to add more than one workout at once, you can post to /api/users/me/results/bulk.

This takes an array of results. The return response will be an array of results or error messages, similar to posting individual results, but with an additional status code. The status code of the responsed will always be 200.

#### Example URI

POST <https://log.concept2.com/api/users/me/results/bulk>

Webhook [¶](#webhook)
---------------------

Through your self-service developer portal, you can register and manage a webhook that will fire when a relevant result is added, updated, or deleted. Relevant results for a given client are those belonging to users who have authorized the client. When firing, the webhook will return one of `result-added`, `result-updated` or `result-deleted`, along with the result payload.

When a result is created or updated for one of the users of your client, your webhook will receive a POST at the specified endpoint with the type of event (see above) and the result payload. This is the same information as a client would receive from requesting the result directly.

* Body

    ```
    {
            "data": {
              "type": "result-added",
              "result":
                {
                  "id": 3,
                  "user_id": 1,

                }
            }
        }
    ```

When a result is deleted for one of the users of your client, your webhook will receive a POST at the specified endpoint with the type of event (see above) and the ID of the deleted result.

* Body

    ```
    {
        "data": {
          "type": "result-deleted",
